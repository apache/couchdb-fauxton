<div class="config-cluster-warning">
  Configuration is just available on the so called Backdoor-Ports for each single node of
  the Cluster.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>Warning!</strong>
  Please don't try to change config via the _config endpoint for a
  clustered setup of CouchDB, it may lead to very weird and strange bugs as
  the configuration is different on each node!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  We suggest to use configuration management tools for configuration changes
  of a multi node cluster.
